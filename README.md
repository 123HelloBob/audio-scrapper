# Audio Scrapper 

A simple cli tool that will scrap audio from youtube if a match is found.
This offers two main usage scenarios:

## Usage 

### Usage with spotify
cargo run -- spotify ~/outputdir

### Usage with txt file 
cargo run -- file  ./input.txt  ~/outputdir


Anyone got the balls to roll the dice with my app credentials?
